# Insurance-Cost-Prediction

## Introduction
The final part of the project focus on the implementation of an end-to-end program. To be more specific, we built a web application on insurance price prediction based on Python Flask and Random Forest Regressor. 

## Feature
1. Exploring the dataset. 
2. Converting Categorical values to Numerical Data Preparation.
3. Prediction using Random Forest Regressor. 
4. Preparing model for deployment. 
5. Deployed model using Flask. 

## Dataset
The dataset used could be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance 

## Usage
1. Install Ptyon 3.7.0
2. Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run application: `python app.py`
